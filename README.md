1. TOWERS OF HANOI
   
The Towers of Hanoi is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that demonstrates recursion and algorithmic problem-solving.

ðŸ“– Problem Statement:
The Towers of Hanoi puzzle consists of three pegs (towers) and n disks of different sizes. Initially, all the disks are stacked in decreasing size on one peg (largest at the bottom, smallest at the top). The goal is to move the entire stack to another peg following these rules:
    1.Only one disk can be moved at a time.
    2.A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg.
    3.Only the top disk of any peg can be moved.

ðŸ’¡ Recursive Solution:
The puzzle can be solved using a simple recursive strategy:
    1.Move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg.
    2.Move the nth (largest) disk to the destination peg.
    3.Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the destination peg.
